## 💭 Process
I began by gathering all the necessary images for the menu and the restaurant. Then, I started by hard coding the front-end application as you can see it's deployed on vercel for now, and after that i connected PostgreSQL and prisma for the back-end development to make the application dynamic. Then, I established constants and implemented Zustand for state management. Next, I added the stripe payment system to the application.
